# Drag-Divergence-Mach-Number-Interpolation
Using MATLAB and CFD data to predict the drag-divergence Mach number given the coefficient of lift, thickness ratio, and sweep angle of a wing.
Accurate for wings with a relative camber of 0.04 and a maximum relative camber located at 0.4 of the chord length.
